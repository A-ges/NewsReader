# NewsReader
This repository was created for our Software Engineering for CSAI course. Our task was to develop an application that assists visually impaired people in accessing information. Naturally, our group decided to create NewsReader. The goal is to build accessible summarization and text-to-speech software, specialized in news-related content.
